          <h2>The $truth</h2>
          <p>You can’t ignore the truth.</p>
          <p>The truth is that the world is moving towards a point where a new
            globally currency will take over the new financial system.</p>
          <p>The truth is that the truth is up to us.</p>
          <p>That we stake our faith in the truth that we want.</p>
          <p>That currency is a representation of faith.</p>
          <p>That truth is coming and we are deciding what truth that is, by
            where we stake our faith.</p>
          <p>Some people have capabilities to move the truth more than
            others.</p>
          <p>The truth is made by us.</p>
          <p>The truth is that we all want a great world.</p>
          <p>The truth is that we are caught up in deception and consumerism and
            denying the truth.</p>
          <p>Denying our higher selves the chance to fully play.</p>
          <p>Existential awareness of the necessity of bringing out our higher
            selves is pushed forward by the truth coming to fruition.</p>
          <p>By reality staring you in the face, and asking you “who are
            you”</p>
          <p>All of us will make the choice that we are good.</p>
          <p>The greatest truth is that all we need to do is hold on to
            gratitude and that greatness will flow from that.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Currency As A Shared Belief</h2>
            <p>So swallow whole, with these holy vibes, cause this world's
              ill.</p>
            <p>And spread it, since clearly that pill is passing through
              Uranus.</p>
            <p>Currency itself is a shared belief system, its value is defined
              based on how we value it.</p>
            <p>Gold worked great for this until 1971 when the US decided to stop
              being limited by a gold reserve. At this time, the biggest shit
              coin was born.</p>
            <p>Thus, an ultimate source of power was formed. The ability to
              literally print money.</p>
            <p>And around it an oasis of corruption is inevitable.</p>
            <p>Any instrument so powerful, that the greediest people alive all
              seek it, becomes evil lurking who would do anything to protect
              it.</p>
            <p>From corruption to cabal, this is where the collective idea of an
              evil mafia came from.</p>
            <p>Collective idea, huh, that's exactly what a meme is after
              all.</p>

            <h2>The Rise of Bitcoin - Old Guard and Redefining Power</h2>
            <p>This exact understanding was what led the pioneers of Bitcoin and
              its early supporters into action.</p>
            <p>Led by something bigger than money… a cure to the mafia's
              greatest ally, the printing machine, whose side effects are best
              found if you search up WTF happened in 1971, the year we created
              that bitch.</p>
            <p>So you may wonder the recent rally at hand, well, while a certain
              bank man fried crypto for a bit, the inevitable nature of its
              existence has steamrolled into the hearts, minds, and wallets of
              the mafia itself.</p>
            <p>There’s been a vibe shift.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin is the gunshot heard around the world.</p>
            <p>Mafia members grabbed their own share and now with a profit
              incentive pushed gigantic financial institutions into their
              investment.</p>
            <p>What they may or may not realize, is this greed will ultimately
              be their downfall.</p>
            <p>Many of the corrupt, are just broken souls, so with the chance to
              repent “if you can’t beat em, join em” became self evident.</p>
            <p>And great, if Bitcoin wins they lose the printing power, but does
              it really have the narrative? The better question is to ask, would
              they have ever let it get this big if it did?</p>
            <p>The horse and carriage started the race, but with Uranus we can
              reach the finish.</p>
            <p>I'd say its the perfect resistance.</p>
            <p>Sounds tight, right?</p>
            <p>Jokes aside, Uranus represents an astronomical tool to make our
              global mafia's power take a big fat dump.</p>

            <h2>Meme Magic Are Shaping Our Digital Destiny</h2>
            <p>This revolution will not be televised, it will be memed.</p>
            <p>Fought not with blades, bullets, or bombs, butt jokes.</p>
            <p>So right now we invite you to make Uranus revolutionary, and
              spread it wide.</p>
            <p>For this is the time we need to wake up, have a coffee, and take
              a celestial dump on the power of their printing machine.</p>
            <p>All these laughs, are expensed by the new world order.</p>
            <p>Each ounce of belief we steal from them through comedy gold and
              into comedy gold is an ounce more of hope for our future.</p>
            <p>It’s time to let golden memes light up the world, because central
              banking digital currencies simply can not. And Remember, it’s
              written in the stars.</p>
            <p>The age of Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet that governs
              innovation, technology, and surprising events.</p>
            <p>While some seek the just a full moon, we seek the depths of
              Uranus.</p>
